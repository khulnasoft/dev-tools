  "# Design System Component Reference\n\nThis document provides a comprehensive overview of the design system's component architecture and available components for code generation and development reference.\n\n## System Architecture\n\nThe design system follows a modular component-based architecture where each component provides specific functionality. Components are organized into logical groups that can work independently or in combination with other components.\n\n### Component Organization Principles\n\n- **Single Responsibility**: Each component serves a specific purpose\n- **Composability**: Components can be combined to create complex interfaces\n- **Consistency**: All components follow the same design patterns and API conventions\n- **Accessibility**: Components are built with accessibility standards in mind\n\n## Documentation Structure\n\nFor detailed documentation on any component, refer to the corresponding MDX file in the `design-system-docs` folder. The documentation files follow the naming convention:\n\n```\ndesign-system-docs/[componentname].mdx\n```\n\nFor example:\n- `design-system-docs/Button.mdx` - Detailed documentation for Button component\n- `design-system-docs/Table.mdx` - Detailed documentation for Table component\n- `design-system-docs/AnnotationContext.mdx` - Detailed documentation for AnnotationContext\n- `design-system-docs/AppLayout.mdx` - Detailed documentation for AppLayout component\n\nThese MDX files contain comprehensive information including:\n- Component API documentation\n- Usage examples\n- Props and configuration options\n- Best practices and implementation guidelines\n- Accessibility requirements\n- Integration patterns with other components\n\n## Components\n\n{{COMPONENTS}}\n{{ICONS}}\n{{TOKENS}}\n\n## Usage Guidelines\n\n### Component Dependencies\n- Most components are self-contained and can be used independently\n- Identify any components that require multiple components to work together\n- Some components work better in combination (e.g., Form + FormField, Table + Pagination)\n\n### Integration Patterns\n- Layout components typically serve as containers for other components\n- Form controls should be wrapped in FormField components for proper labeling\n- Navigation components can be used independently or as part of larger layout structures\n- Data display components can be enhanced with interactive elements like buttons and popovers\n\n### Accessibility Considerations\n- All components are built with accessibility in mind\n- Use semantic HTML structures provided by the components\n- Leverage built-in ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation\n- The LiveRegion component provides additional accessibility announcements when needed\n\n### Responsive Design\n- Layout components provide responsive behavior out of the box\n- Grid and ColumnLayout components adapt to different screen sizes\n- Mobile-friendly navigation patterns are built into navigation components\n\n## Usage Reference\n\nThis reference should be used to understand the available components and their intended purposes when generating code or building applications with this design system. For specific implementation details, always consult the corresponding MDX documentation file in the `design-system-docs` folder.";
